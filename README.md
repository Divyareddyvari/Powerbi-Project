Project: Customer purchasing behavior
Field: E-Commerce
Tools: Power Bi, Power query

This is one of my recent sample works created using Power BI. I completed the entire project within a week. Created KPIs, Parameters and Drill Through. Created high level dashboards.

Task: Analyze the dataset and extract meaningful insights to guide marketing campaigns and improve customer segmentation. The main goal was to provide actionable recommendations that would drive revenue growth.
I conducted a thorough data exploration, understanding the structure and quality of the dataset. I cleaned and transformed the data, addressing missing values and outliers to ensure data accuracy.

I performed extensive statistical analysis and data mining techniques, such as segmentation analysis, and data modeling. Throughout the analysis, I maintained clear documentation of my methods, assumptions, and findings, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
